## 🎲 Game Rules

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular casino card game. Here's a quick overview of the rules:

1. The goal is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21 points.
2. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
3. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable.
4. Other cards are worth their face value.
5. Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden.
6. Players can request additional cards ("hit") or stop at their current total ("stand").
7. If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they bust and lose.
8. After all players have finished, the dealer reveals their hidden card and hits or stands according to specific rules.
9. The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, or if the dealer busts.
